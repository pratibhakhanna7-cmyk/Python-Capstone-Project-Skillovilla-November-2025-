# Python Capstone Project (Skillovilla)

## Project Overview:
This project involves building a consolidated analytical dataset to calculate employee-level project costs and business metrics. Using **Python** and **Pandas**, the project integrates multiple datasets, applies business logic, and generates insightful, business-ready reports.

## Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values using a custom running-average algorithm.
- **Data Integration:** Merged employee, project, and seniority datasets into a single consolidated data frame.
- **Business Logic:** Applied rules to calculate bonuses, update designations, and compute project costs.
- **Analytical Views:** Generated filtered views for city-level analysis and other targeted metrics.

## Results:
- Produced accurate, business-ready reports detailing the total project cost per employee.
- Achieved a perfect score (100%) on the project, showcasing proficiency in **Python**, **Pandas**, and **data analysis**.
